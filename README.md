# Bare Bones Language Model

A PyTorch starter for doing something actually interesting.

## Development

This project follows these principles:

- _Explicit_, because you shouldn't have to guess
- _Dependency-light_, because dependencies break
- _Concise_, because verbose code is skimmed & ignored
